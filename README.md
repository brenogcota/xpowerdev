## üöÄ X Power Dev (or something better)

This script automates the process of Development and creating a GitHub pull request based on a Jira ticket. It fetches information about the Jira ticket, such as summary and description, and uses it to create a pull request on a GitHub repository. This automation helps streamline the workflow for developers who use Jira for issue tracking and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

### Features ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ñ
- **Efficient Workflow:** With a simple command, developers can create a feature branch, commit changes, push the branch to GitHub, and open a pull request, all in one go.
- **Automatic PR Title:** The script extracts the Jira ticket summary and uses it as the title of the GitHub pull request, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication.
- **Customizable Branch Naming:** The script generates a feature branch name based on the Jira ticket key, making it easy to identify the associated work.
- **Detailed PR Description:** The pull request description includes the Jira ticket key and description, providing context to reviewers about the changes being proposed.
